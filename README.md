This is my attempt at reproducing the google homepage's appearance with my aquired css and html knowledge. No javascript was utilized and none of the links actually redirect to any pages as the goals was to emulate the style of the page.

How to use flexbox and arrange flexbox elements
How to remove unwanted space after inline-block elements
How to create a floating nav bar
How to center objects horizontally
How to allow the page to be scrolled horizontally and vertically (to avoid scaling elements to be too tiny when display size is small)
How to allow zooming into the page without the formatting of elements changing
How to keep footer bars stuck to the bottom of the page even after zooming in and out on the page
How to use the ::before pseudo element to insert background images to be used as icons
How to make images into links
How to style pseudo classes to elements (including pseudo elements)
How to add multiple buttons to the same form
How to create a container that occupies the whole page
How to adjust the size of text inputs (for forms) and of buttons
How to add icons to the head title
How to better organize my css files
The idea that id should name the element and class should describe the element
To use normalize css files to maintain more consistancy in style across browsers
Prevent input elements from being moved by padding (Still shaky on this, need to experiment more)
